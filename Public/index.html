                <p>Hi Babyyy, happiest birthday to you my loving ainee. You have grown so much over the years. Endured and achieved so much that it makes me so proud to talk about you. My pretty baby, my gorgeous girl,my cutiepie. You are and will always be my love, my pride and my life.
                    Watching you from afar or by your side as you do things on your own, as you get what you hoped for and as you achieve what you've dreamt of. All those things make me feel contented knowing that in some way I was a part of it, that I am a part of your life.
                    I'm really happy to be with you, aine. To grow with you. To experience life with you. To go through life that's full of uncertainties, together. </p><br><br> <p> Today marks the start of you taking big steps towards life. The age of legality. This is where life gets serious.
                    Where our choices matter. It may be scary and challenging but know that I am here. I will hold your hand whenever you feel weak. Lift your hand when you fall. Wipe your tears when everything feels heavy. Always remember that I am your help, I will do what I can for you.
                    Let's keep on pursuing greatness, a better future and us. We may not be in the best situation that we could be right now, but know that all of these are a part of our path for a better future for each other.</p> <br> <p> I will always love you, aine. Happy Birthday.  I'm glad to share my life with you.</p>
